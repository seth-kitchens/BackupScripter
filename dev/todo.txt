Backup Scripter

Todo
---
Legend

NSS: nssgui
BS: BackupScripter
SL: scriptlib (still a part of BackupScripter, BS may include SL)

- Normal
* Important
---

QoL, Settings
- BS: add default locations for main page file browsing
- BS: consider settings for editor, particularly default browse locations
	- settings screen?

Bugs, Poorly Implemented
* BS: script destination not updated when loading script
* BS: window_edit_matching_groups quits on X pressed, even though there is no code. The event is falling through into window_manage_included's event loop somehow, and that window thinks its X was pressed, then calling event_win_closed().
* BS: in windows/manage_included.py, Resolve All does not remove root folders
- NSS: make units dropdown from InputUnits ordered correctly
- NSS: InfoButton and Info is messy
* BS: Check behavior of scripts where static inclusion has mismatch at script runtime, i.e. something specified as included/excluded
does not exist. This should be reported during script execution. Also when loading a script or loading defaults.

Tests
- BS: Make test for 2+ roots included with identical names (after first, should be renamed with _2, _3, ... appended)

Unimplemented
- NSS: A ToolBar class would be nice
- BS: Implement compression settings
- BS: in assert_files_match_zip in test_core.py, implement compare_contents
- BS: in script/details.py add (# days old) text to backup-to-be-overwritten segment
- BS: in script/app.py add option to edit scripts with editor
- BS: in scriptlib/.../script_data.py:ScriptData:verify_file_is_script(), make a more through check, perhaps by inserting data into the pyz
- NSS: Increase performance by making a lazy init function in gem, as in gem.layout(class, *args, *kwargs) that calls init IF first call
- BS: add relative paths (might have to be explicit)
- BS: add matching option for age of file
- BS: should there be a way to see the include>exclude>include>... structure in vfs explorer?
- BS: implement opening script with backupscripter

Design, Behavior, Error Prevention
- NSS: event manager handle_event_function() is confusing. Why are the rv's ignored?
- BS: rename bs.el package/alias
- BS: The default matching groups are automatically processed upon program start, which affects loading time. Something should be done about this.
* NSS: em should be pulled into window and ge as a base class
* NSS/BS: Every blocking window should have some way of exiting the entire program.
- NSS/BS: improve consistency with 'folder' vs 'dir'
- BS: pulling date from files only works if no periods in file name or date string, enforce this with GUI
- NSS: making the edit window for ListContainer was messy and poorly documented. This needs to be easier to understand.
- SL: how do changes to code affect backwards compatibility with existing pyz scripts? how to prevent the functions from breaking when accessing pyz script generated from older code?
- NSS: should the event_loop() function really be in the event_manager class?
- NSS: folder browse button for StringContainer/TextList is currently a part of StringContainer (in the init), shouldn't it be a part of TextList instead?
- NSS: are asyncwindows disabled from context.disable()?
- NSS: gem.row/etc should be self.row in window classes. Maybe use a iGEManager interface for passing gem as param as well?
- NSS/BS: Error prevention needed. Try unintended actions to see what happens, and fix.
- NSS: currently every element saves data, shouldn't there be an option, especially for output elements?
- BS: Add color to vfs explorer for included/excluded (very pale red/green)w

Documentation
- BS: clean and document project/create.py
- NSS/BS: convert above-function comments to docstrings so that they can be seen in ide
- NSS/BS: look over and update existing documentation
- BS: update FSDef in test_core.py with correct documentation of TestFile and TestDir

Inclusion Matching
- BS: Implement Inclusion Matching
- BS: Does including with pattern matching include appropriate parent folders
- BS: Should inclusion require a 'within path' ?

Project Organization, Version Control
- NSS: vfs explorer view is still somewhat project specific
- NSS: move EmbedText from nssgui.sg.utils to somewhere better
