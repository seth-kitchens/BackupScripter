Formatting for BackupScripter (and PsgUnsimplified)

---
PEP8 Exceptions, etc

Lines longer 79 lines

- For aligning words in consecutive, similar lines. Example:
	some_func('This is a str',                  5, cls.RED,    'append')
	some_func('This is a longer str',          25, cls.BLUE,   'truncate')
	some_func('This str is so long, it\'s necessary to break the rule',
											  120, cls.ORANGE, 'default')
	some_func('Short str',                      5, cls.RED,    'append')
	some_func('This is a very very long str', 120, cls.ORANGE, 'default')
- A comment on a single line of code may go over 79 characters (not the code itself)

Line Breaks

- Hanging indents may include arguments on the first line (Explicitly non-PEP8). This is not suggested for kwarg-only function calls
	- Good:
		func('one', 'two', three='three',
			four='four', five='five')

Blank lines in functions

- Functions should not have blank lines in them as a base practice
- Inner functions should be surrounded by single blank lines
- A commented logical block of code should be surrounded by blank lines
	- So, make a logical, commented block of code if a blank line would be appropriate
	- There can still be lone comments without blank lines
- A block of strongly related code may have blank lines around it without a comment:
	x = some_func()
	
	my_list = []
	my_list.append(my_class('a', 2))
	my_list.append(my_class('b', 3))
	my_list.append(my_class('c', 7))
	my_list.append(my_class('d', 13))
	
	y = another_func()
