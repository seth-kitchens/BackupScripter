# BackupScripter
A backup script editor with a GUI. Still a work-in-progress. Create a single-file executable .pyz file that compiles files and folders into a single file (e.g. .zip). Has a basic file explorer for browsing included directories and choosing directories to exclude, showing the size and nested item counts for directory items. Use matching groups to dynamically exclude (include not supported yet) files and folders based off of patterns and conditions checked at script runtime.
